# Description

This sample app automatically replies to texts sent to your Bandwidth number. The reply depends on the text received: `STOP`, `QUIT`, `HELP` and `INFO` each get their own reply, and anything else gets a prompt to reply `HELP`. Keywords are matched against the whole message and are not case sensitive.

The `STOP` and `QUIT` replies are for demonstration only. This app doesn't keep track of opt-outs, so it will keep replying to a number that has sent `STOP`.

In order to use the correct endpoints, you must check the "Use multiple callback URLs" box on the application page in Dashboard. Then in Dashboard, set the INBOUND CALLBACK to `/callbacks/inbound/messaging` and the STATUS CALLBACK to `/callbacks/outbound/messaging/status`. The same can be accomplished via the Dashboard API by setting `InboundCallbackUrl` and `OutboundCallbackUrl` respectively.

Inbound callbacks are sent notifying you of a received message on a Bandwidth number. This app prints the phone numbers involved and the text received, then sends the reply. Outbound callbacks are status updates for messages sent from a Bandwidth number, this app has a dedicated response for each type of status update.

# Pre-Requisites

In order to use the Bandwidth API users need to set up the appropriate application at the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and create API tokens.

To create an application log into the [Bandwidth Dashboard](https://dashboard.bandwidth.com/) and navigate to the `Applications` tab.  Fill out the **New Application** form selecting the service (Messaging or Voice) that the application will be used for.  All Bandwidth services require publicly accessible Callback URLs, for more information on how to set one up see [Callback URLs](#callback-urls).

For more information about API credentials see our [Account Credentials](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/account/credentials) page.

# Running the Application

To install the required packages for this app, run the command:

```sh
composer install
```

Use the following command to run the application:

```sh
composer start
```

# Environmental Variables

The sample app uses the below environmental variables.

```sh
BW_ACCOUNT_ID                        # Your Bandwidth Account Id
BW_CLIENT_ID                         # Your Bandwidth API OAuth Client Id
BW_CLIENT_SECRET                     # Your Bandwidth API OAuth Client Secret
BW_NUMBER                            # The Bandwidth phone number involved with this application
BW_MESSAGING_APPLICATION_ID          # Your Messaging Application Id created in the dashboard
LOCAL_PORT                           # The port number you wish to run the sample on
```

# Callback URLs

For a detailed introduction, check out our [Bandwidth Messaging Callbacks](https://dev.bandwidth.com/docs/messaging/webhooks) page.

Below are the callback paths:
* `/callbacks/outbound/messaging/status` For Outbound Status Callbacks
* `/callbacks/inbound/messaging` For Inbound Message Callbacks

## Ngrok

A simple way to set up a local callback URL for testing is to use the free tool [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).  
After you have downloaded and installed `ngrok` run the following command to open a public tunnel to your port (`$LOCAL_PORT`)

```sh
ngrok http $LOCAL_PORT
```

You can view your public URL at `http://127.0.0.1:4040` after ngrok is running.  You can also view the status of the tunnel and requests/responses here. Once your public ngrok url has been created, use it as the base of the callback URLs in the messaging application created in the [Pre-Requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
